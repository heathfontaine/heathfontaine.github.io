									<b>American Family Insurance - Business Design Specialist</b>
									<br>
									May 2021 - April 2022
									<br>
									Backend developer and DevOps engineer for the technical side of the department. I am in charge of architecting and implementing ventures we pursue into AWS using IaC for easy DR and reusable resources for future ventures. I'm also involved in our internship program, ensuring I am available to answer questions and pair program to help both of us learn.

In between ventures, I spend my time researching emerging technologies to enhance my domain knowledge and apply it to future ventures.  
									<br>
									<br>
									Since this department puruses business ventures, I've been lucky to also have been a part of ideation sessions about choosing business categories to pursue, and trying to shape the feasibility of investing in them. This has taught me quite a bit about all the nuances that come along with starting a brand new company, such as financial modeling and unit economics, go-to-market strategies, and validation testing.

									<b>Forcepoint LLC - Cyber Engineer I/II/III</b>
									<br>
									October 2017 - April 2021
									<br>
									When I started at Forcepoint, I focused on helping customers with upgrading and implementing the Forcepoint product to fit their needs. This includes constant customer communication, remote and onsite sessions, and scripting solutions to help with day-to-day pain points the customer experiences.
									<br>
									<br>
									As time went on, I shifted from being directly customer facing to the automation side, where I help our Cyber Assessments (similar to an environment health check) automatically grab data from a customer's environment. This sped up manually collecting data by 80%. The tool I developed consists of Python and Powershell. My job involves coding, working with a customer's environment, and working extensively with other Forcepoint teams to assist in finding the location of the required data.

								<h2 class="major">Work-Related Projects</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Chatbot</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												The motivation behind a Chatbot was surrounded by the question of "How might we leverage emerging technologies to assist an employee in saving time?" Therefore, the idea of a Chatbot that can answer question or complete tasks was formulated and is constantly being worked on. There are tasks employees do daily, and much time can be saved if the task can be done by a simple message to a Chatbot. Emloyees and departments reach out to our team in order to request functionality that can assist the company as a whole.
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												The technologies leveraged for the Chatbot primarily include various services in AWS. The services include a new natural language processing tool <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/" target=_blank>Amazon Lex</a>. Alongside Lex, we utilize Lambdas, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, and many more services. 
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												My primary role on the team was to create intents (or functions) for the Chatbot. Each intent requires a set of utterances or phrases related to the intent in order to train the bot to understand when the intent a user is requesting. After creating the list of utterances with the customer or intent requestor, I would program the functionality, do extensive testing to ensure that not only the next intent functions correctly, but also no previous intent broke when training the bot, and then demo to the customer.
											</p>
										<li>RightTrack Tag</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												The RightTrack Program at Liberty Mutual is a 90 day, voluntary program for auto insurance customers where a user plugs in a device to their car that tracks various driving statistics. After the evaluation period, the customer would receive a discount on their auto insurance premium based on his or her driving statistics. The problem with what was in place is that some older cars are not compatible with OBD2 devices, and that could cause some poor customer experience. On top of that, it was not convenient for a user to check current driving stats. Therefore, with the new program of RightTrack Tag, there would be a new device that was compatible with all cars, and also an app where you can see your stats in real-time from a mobile device.
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												We partnered with two external teams in order to take on this new program. One team was dedicated to the Tag device while the other was in charge of the new app. As the Liberty team, we were in charge of setting up a new program in our system for the pilot states and integrating our systems with the other two teams' systems in order to make sure every component of the project functioned together correctly. 
											</p>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												My primary role on the team was to create automated tests that would run after changes were made. This helped to reassure us that if new functionality broke after any deploy, we could catch the bug as early as possible. Many tests were made using <a href=http://www.seleniumhq.org/ target=_blank>Selenium</a>. These tests helped to free up manual testing by the members of my team. On top of creating tests, I was also a point of contact with the external teams since I was usually the first to know if a bug was discovered by one of my tests.
											</p>
										<li>Automated Data Gathering</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												One of my responsibilities at Forcepoint was to help automate the collection of data for a Cyber Assessment (similar to an environment health check). Using Python and Powershell, I made a tool that can run in a customer environment that finds all the relevant Forcepoint servers (anywhere from 4 - 120 seen so far), detemine the OS and collect relevant data (whether using Powershell scripts, API calls, basic linux commads, etc.) and do analysis. It sped up the steps to do each server manually by 75%.
											<p>
										<li>Paramiko Shell Prototype</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												My job at Forcepoint was heavily focused on using PuTTY to SSH into appliances and do work there. The problem is it quite a process to log in as root (involving getting encrypted passwords and decrypting them multiple times). Using the Python paramiko library, I was able to make a prototype for a shell window that bypassed many of these steps and automated the password collecting and decrypting. The user could then navigate the appliance as root as if it were a regular PuTTY window.

								<h2 class="major">Personal Projects</h2>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Conway's Game of Life</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> started out as a school project for one of my classes. I implemented a text-based version of the game using a user-specified number of threads. After creating the project in C, I wanted to recreate the project in Java to see the differences between the two langauges. Eventually, when I was learned Android development, I created a Game of Life app on my phone.
											<p>
										<li>Fighting Quest</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												My interest in video games led me to work on creating an extremely simple turn-based rpg app for Android. I used this and the Game of Life as introductory apps for Android development. Throughout creating this app, I learned various different techniques for video game development. Some examples include a store for in-game currency, saving map location and character statistics, and learning I should find someone else to do art for me.
											<p>
										<li>Times Table Training</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												My first experience with mobile application development was iOS development. The first simple app I worked on for iOS was math related. The idea was to have a multiple choice, timed multiplication table quiz. A user would have a user-specified amount of time to answer as many multiplication questions as possible. The user earned coins for correct answers, and could use those coins to buy different background/button themes.
											<p>
										<li>Efficient Automatic Lights</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												Researched and implemented a prototype of an efficient automatic light system using an Arduino and LED light strips to simulate energy saving techniques
											<p>
										<li>3D Function Modeling</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												Collaborated with colleagues and a professor to create a program in Unity to graph a user-provided 3D function that is now used in Calculus 3 courses to assist with 3D graph visualization
											<p>
										<li>Risk Radar</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												For a work-related hackathon, my team and I created a website called Risk Radar. The website allowed a user to enter a city or zip code. The webpage would then display a map of the specified area, alongside information on the biggest insurance risks in that area and ways to avoid each risk. For example, in a place with high water damage, we would recommend occasional checking of pipes and the idea of investing in a smart leak detector. 
											<p>
										<li>VR Office Tour</li>
											<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
												For my next hackathon project, I pitched to my team an idea regarding mobile VR. The idea is to use Unity and various mobile VR headsets (Google Dayream and Samsung Gear) to create a virtual office. Within the app, a user can travel through the modelled office. There will also be options to chose a meeting room and get a lit up path to find the specified room. The big motivation for the project was the idea of using a newer technology and attempting to discover how we can leverage VR in different settings.
